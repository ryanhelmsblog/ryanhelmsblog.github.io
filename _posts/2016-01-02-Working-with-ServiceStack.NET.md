## My experience working with ServiceStack.NET

  As a developer, I think yo are always on the path of trying to figure out how you can get from point a to point b faster, more efficiently and with less code. It is rare that you find a single tool that helps you with those 3 point (and MANY MANY more). Well, I have found that tool for me, welcome [ServiceStack.NET](http://www.servicestack.net/).
